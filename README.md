10 Academy: Artificial Intelligence Mastery Week 0 Challenge

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to identify high-potential regions for solar installation. The focus is on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning the dataset, and visualizing insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.


Objectives

Perform EDA to uncover trends and insights.

Clean and preprocess the dataset.

Build and deploy an interactive Streamlit dashboard.



Installation

Clone the repository:
